I am a sophomore computer science major here at the University of Tennessee and learning as a **VOL** is very fun. I
was born in Kingsport, TN and really enjoy how close Knoxville is. Some of my interests include:
listening to music, playing basketball, going for runs, reading, and sometimes coding :-). 

I am most familiar with C++ and C, but I have some experience with Java and Python, with familiarity in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
In terms of technologies, I use VSCode and vim for text editing. I have learned some features of Git and Github in preparation
for this class but haven't fully mastered the work flow yet.

Here is a list of some of the best albums ever created (open for discussion and additions):
- *In Rainbows*, Radiohead
- *Kid A*, Radiohead (yes, those Brits are *that* good)
- *In the Court of the Crimson King*, King Crimson
- *Sound of Silver*, LCD Soundsystem
- *Remain in Light*, Talking Heads
- *22, A Million*, Bon Iver	
- *Cosmogramma*, Flying Lotus
- *To Pimp a Butterfly*, Kendrick Lamar

If anyone would ever like to watch the best cinematic experiences of all time, I highly recommend [*The Nut Job (2014)*](https://the-nut-job.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page+)!
