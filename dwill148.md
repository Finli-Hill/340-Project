## Background
My background is heavily focused around networking and IT, I started working in telecommunications almost 10 years ago. I was a co-owner of an IT Consulting business for 2.5 years and I currently work for UTK as a Linux Systems Administator. I've been working with OIT for over 5 years now. (Mostly as a student worker)

## Interests
Most of my interests revolve around computers and the digital world. For work I am focused on DHCP/DNS processes and Automation / DevOps. In school and hobbies my focus is around AI / Machine learning and Computer Graphics, I dabble with all the new software/tools I can to help me realize my visions. I also have a strong calling to bio-inspired computation and how to replicate processes that are found in nature.
