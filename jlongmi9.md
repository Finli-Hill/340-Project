# Jackson Dean Longmire
## Background
My name is Dean Longmire (jlongmi9) and I am a Computer Science major, you can find me on GitHub as DeanLongmire.  
I grew up in Knoxville and got my Associate's in Computer Science at Pellissippi State in Hardin Valley. 
## Interests
I really enjoy programming, especially in new languages that I have not been exposed to.  
Apart from that I participate in intramural sports with my roomates, like watching movies, and sometimes play video games when I have a break.
## Technical Skills
I am familiar with GitHub already as I have used it for personal projects. I, like most of you in this class, prefer to work in VS Code. I think that its many extensions make it one of the best text editors out there.  
Over my time at college I have learned a couple of different languages of coding (most of these in the last couple of months).
* C++
* C
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Python (just a little)

I recently made a very limited website that makes use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and you can visit it [here](https://deanlongmire.github.io/Temperature-Converter/).  
I also recently accepted a summer internship with KUB as a software developer, and I am very excited to start there this May.
