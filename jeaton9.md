# About me 
## Contact
**Name**:Joseph Eaton (I go by Joseph)

**Netid**: jeaton9

**GitHub**: JosephE0

**email**: jeaton9@vols.utk.edu
## Academic Information
**Major**: Electrical Engineering

**Minor**: Computer Science
## Background
I go by Joseph, and I am the first of my immediate family to get a degree! This is my last semester (wish me luck).

I am majoring in electrical engineering because it makes up much of what is around us, and my
family is full of linemen/electricians for generations. I chose to seek a computer science minor
because I have always been interested in programming.
## Languages
* I am willing to learn any language required for the project, but I know the following...
   1. **C++**
   2. **C**
   3. A small amount of **Swift** (used to create software over a summer internship)
   4. Taking a course this semester using **Python**, and another using **C#**, but no prior experience
## Interests
* Two of my hobbies:
   1. Scuba Diving
   2. Quadcopter racing/aerobatics

I have been involved in scuba since 2015, and have gone as far as decompression diving up to 160 ft. in depth - don't do this.
Link for an interesting [dive on the USS Oriskany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09N0oUPRITo).

Link for an example of the type of [drone flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylRn9zfdgQs) that I'm interested in.

I hope some of you to get into simple drone flying, but I need to warn you that quadcopters like the one in the video here
can be inherintely dangerous, especially for your fingers.
