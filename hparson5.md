## Background:
### I'm from Kansas City and I technically live on the Missouri side (barely), but I was born in Kansas and all my family is from Kansas so I claim to be from Kansas.

## Interests:
### My interests are really all over the place, from more-or-less stereotypical college interests like sports and video games to less common interests like learning foreign languages, I find just about everything interesting -- or at least to an extent. There are obviously a few expections, but the only main one is history.

## Languages, Tools, & Frameworks:
1. C++                          -- very comfortable
2. C                            -- somewhat comfortable
3. Java ; JavaScript            -- super rusty
4. Python ; HTML & CSS          -- hardly remember a single thing
