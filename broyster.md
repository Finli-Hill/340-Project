# Assigment 1
Benjamin Royster, Ben is what I go by, netid: broyster, GitHub: broyster7, Major: Computer Engineering 
## Background
I am a Knoxville local studying Computer Engineering. I am currently working on a CubeSat project for ORNL, and I previously created a proposed layout for a room in the Data Center building at ORNL. I also created a MIDI controller using a basys 3 board and VHDL code.
## Interests
My interests are very broad in the engineering world, but I would like to explore more into cyber security, 3D modeling, soldering, and new coding languages. Outside of school I compete in powerlifting and am involved with that here at UTK. I also enjoy playing video games.
