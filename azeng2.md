I born into a loving Chinese family with two older brothers that both went into the medical field. I enjoy video games, outdoors activities(running, camping, hiking), and [robotics](https://ynotutk.wixsite.com/website/ "The robotics team I am on"). Some computer languages, tools, and frameworks that I am filmilar with is C/C++, Unreal Engine 5, HTML5, CSS, Mathlab, PROS, VEX Code, and a little bit of markdown.
