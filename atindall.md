## Background

I am originally from Kentucky, but I grew up in Chattanooga, TN.
Even though I've been in East Tennessee most my life, I am not too familiar with the area.
I tend to only go out to get food, go to the store, or hangout with friends and family.

## Interests

- Video Games: I enjoy playing PC or Nintendo games. Recently, I started playing [*Fire Emblem Engage*](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/). It's been pretty fun. I have also been playing [*Splatoon 3*](https://splatoon.nintendo.com/). My favorite game series is *Pokémon*. I've been playing that since *Pokémon Red* came out in the 90's.
- Tabletop Gaming: Whether role-playing games like [*Dungeons and Dragons*](https://dnd.wizards.com/) or board games like [*Carcassonne*](https://www.zmangames.com/en/products/carcassonne/), I like playing a variety of tabletop games. Though I don't get to play it as much, I enjoy playing *Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition*. It is a tactical space combat game where you maneuver a squadron of iconic *Star Wars* starships to destroy your opponent's squadron.
- Arts & Crafts: I enjoy painting miniatures and resin casting dice for role-playing games. Due to current personal circumstances, I am not able to pursue this interest as much as I would like.
- Reading: I enjoy reading, but I mostly read a few web-comics on [Webtoon](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) these days. For novels, the genres I prefer are thriller, fantasy, and science-fiction.
- YouTube: I like watching a wide variety of gaming and comedy YouTube channels. One of my favorite videos is this [funny cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

## Technical Skills
- C/C++
- Some past experience with MatLab (would need to refresh my knowledge)

I'm interested in learning more about app development, cybersecurity, and game development.
