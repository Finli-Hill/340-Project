# Overview

Hi! My name is Tyler Duckworth and I'm a Computer Science major at UT. I got into computer science in high school when I joined my school's FIRST Robotics team and worked in the Programming subteam. Currently, I work as a Project Intern at [Agilaire](https://agilaire.com/), a software company based here in Knoxville and where I assist in managing  projects for clients and develop tools that use our tech stack. 

## Current Interests/Hobbies

Right now I'm interested in mobile app development, data science, and SQL databases. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, video games, and reading.
