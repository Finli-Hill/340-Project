I am 21 years old and have lived in Knoxville all my life. I play guitar outside of school and have been trying to learn 3D modeling in my free time. I am interested in the graphical side of computer science including 3D modeling and texturing and rendering. I have also been interested in html recently and have dabbled in making my own websites. A link to my favorite website can be found [here](https://www.theonion.com/). I am most comfortable with C++ and am quite comfortable with Git, and plan to learn a variety of languages including C, HTML, Java, and Python this year.
